#  Transcriptomic Analysis of Anaerobic Gut Fungal Life Stages: Zoospores vs Mats

## Background
These scripts generate **global gene expression profiles** and perform **differential gene expression analysis** for zoospore vs mat sample groups.
In this project, **RNA-Seq data** was acquired for two sample groups from the **anaerobic gut fungi** (phylum Neocallimastigomycota) *Neocalliamstix californiae* G1 [[link]](https://mycocosm.jgi.doe.gov/Neosp1/Neosp1.home.html): 
1. Culture cell pellets enriched in **zoospores,** the young life stage of anaerobic gut fungi
2. **Fungal mats** with mixed life stages, including sporangia, the mature life stage of anaerobic gut fungi

The main steps are as follows:
1. Prepare RNA-Seq data for DESeq2 differential gene expression analysis.
2. Perform DESeq2 for log2 fold-change and p-values for differential expression of each gene between the two sample groups.
3. Align functional gene annotations, downloaded from the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) Mycocosm portal [[link]](https://mycocosm.jgi.doe.gov/Neosp1/Neosp1.home.html).
4. Define cutoffs for significant differential regulation of individual genes.
5. For each annotation, generate gene counts for upregulation/downregulation of the annotated genes in zoospores vs. mats. Additionally, generate Fisher's Exact Statistics to describe differential regulation of annotations (distinct from differential regulation of individual genes).
6. Align additional gene annotations, specific to system of study (anaerobic gut fungi).
7. Generate figures to visualize statistics, ie: volcano plots.

## Description of Scripts
This project includes multiple scripts:
| Script Name                                       | Description                               |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Zoospore_RNA_data_analysis_pt1_RNAseq_Cleanup.py | RNA-Seq raw data contains some transcripts with identical amino acid sequences. For the purposes of describing putative functions of the corresponding genes (ID'd by proteinID) to these transcripts, the RNA-Seq raw counts and TPM counts data are consolidated for groups of transcripts with identical amino acid sequence in this script. |
| Zoospore_RNA_data_analysis_pt2_DESeq2_in_R.R | In order to perform differential gene expression (DGE) analysis, this script runs DESeq2 in R to generate log2-fold change data and p-values for each proteinID.  |
| Zoospore_RNA_data_analysis_pt3_DGE_Main_Annotations.py | This script aligns putative functional annotations from JGI Mycocosm to the proteinIDs considered in this dataset. The main annotations considered are KOG, GO, IPR, and KEGG. Significant upregulation of a gene in the zoospores is defined as follows: DESeq2 p-value < 0.05, log2 fold-change < 1, and average TPM in zoospore samples > 1. Significant upregulation of a gene in the mats is defined as follows: DESeq2 p-value < 0.05, log2 fold-change > 1, and average TPM in mat samples > 1. For each gene annotation group, differential expression data is organized, revealing the number of genes in the annotation group that are significantly upregulated in zoospores and the number that are significantly upregulated in mats. These data are necessary for the Fisher's Exact Statistical Tests (see below). This script generates Fisher's Exact Statistical Test data for gene annotation groups of sufficient size (greater than 10 genes). The Fisher's Exact Test generates 2 adjusted p-values for each annotation group to answer two questions: (1) "Is this gene annotation group upregulated in zoospores?" and (2) "Is this gene annotation group significantly upregulated in mats?" Additional annotations are included: secondary metabolites, Orthologous groups with other anaerobic gut fungal strains using results from the OrthoFinder tool, and CAZymes. |
| Zoospore_RNA_data_analysis_pt4_DGE_Additional_Annotations.py | This script takes the results from part 3 and adds Excel sheet outputs to focus on additional specific annotations or format specific annotations introduced in part 3. |
| Zoospore_RNA_data_analysis_pt5_dbCAN2_and_Cellulosomes.py | In order to roughly describe how cellulosome components are differentially regulated in this transcriptomic dataset, proteomics data with previously detected, likely cellulosome components (dockerin or scaffoldin). The tool dbCAN2 predicts additional CAZyme annotations to supplement CAZyme annotations from JGI MycoCosm. |
| Zoospore_RNA_data_analysis_pt6_Volcano_Plots.py | Additional script for generating volcano plots in the publication. |

This .csv describes proteomics data results for N. californiae grown in Medium C with reed canary grass. The proteomics data was originally aligned to one set of N. californiae proteinIDs and filtered for proteinIDs with putative cellulosome component function. In order to match with the rest of this data analysis, I performed local BLASTp of the proteinIDs I am considering (listed in 'Neosp1_FilteredModels5_deflines_post.fasta') against the proteinIDs with proteomics data. The resulting analysis aligns the transcriptomic data (zoospore vs. mats) with proteomics data with putative cellulosome component annotations.
